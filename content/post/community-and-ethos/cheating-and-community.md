blog post on cheating in Scrabble/Boggle and how it might be better to not have leader boards, tournaments, etc. but to promote cohesive clans 

- detecting bots should be easy
- not all people who type fast are bots (show videos)
- "fingerprint" analysis
- can't stop someone who generates the words and types them in manually (unless there was a concentration analysis)
- either way, it would be a monumental undertaking and therefore
- promote clans of people who trust each other, and
- promote people videoing themselves as real players/not-bots
