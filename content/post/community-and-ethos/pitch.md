# Concept Pitch
Wordadoplicus draws the equivalence between **dinosaurs** to **word games**.  Just as there
were many beautiful, awesome, totally sweet **dinosaurs**, there are many
beautiful, awesome and totally sweet **word games**.

Each dinosaur represents a particular configuration of DNA
and evolution and strengths and weaknesses. 

Likewise does a word game. 

One, like Word Racer, may be fast paced and for the young, like 
a voracious velociraptor.

Another, like the typical Word Search, may be more apt
for a more plodding ruminating herbivore (or anyone over 40 or under 6 years of age).

Wordadoplicus is about understanding the constituent DNA of these games, and
pulling them out, and asking "What monster can we breed?"
