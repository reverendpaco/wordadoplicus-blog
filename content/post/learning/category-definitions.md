I am taking advantage of Hugo, the static site generator, to produce this blog
site.  One of the things it encourages is the use of taxonomies, including
categories, which you can see over there on the right.  The above image I threw
together in Omnigraffle to enumerate the categories.  

Here are the definitions:

  - **game-ideas**

All posts within this category are about **ideas** for word games and the
technical and social challenges in implementing them.  They might be
pie-in-the-sky or imminent.  

  - **community-and-ethos** 

Any post concerning itself with the overarching community ideal: how the
community evolves, what prinpciples are supported, how we expect to comport
ourselves, how the forum is to be administered and grown and nurtured, how new
game ideas should be communicated, how abusive behavior is to be tolerated (or
not), how fast people can expect responses, etc.

Most importantly, this category will host any post explaining the ideals of
what [Wordadoplicus](http://wordadoplicus.com) is about: from its notion of evolving games, to word game
DNA, to involving the community.
 
  - **programming** 
  
Anything to do with programming will belong in this category. The question of
what is programming versus architecture is not always an easy one.  The rule of
thumb, is that if the post is about one language or the challenges involved in
one process space, then it is *programming*. 

  - **architecture**
  
Any work created that involves coordinating multiple processes, deploying
machines (virtual, containerized), networking, CDNs, cloud, docker, vagrant,
AWS, s3, bash, etc. will go here.  Development practices, including testing and
develop/deploy strategies should go here. 

  - **technology**

A general catch-all for posts that aren't quite programming nor architecture.
Even non-Wordadoplicus stuff could go here, if it scratches an itch.
  
  - **marketing-and-market-analysis**
  
What other games are out there that might be fun to emulate, improve on, or
learn from.  What are the demographics associated with word game playing?  Are
there some games that attract some types of players over others?  How does
internationalization matter to market reach?  What are the ways to categorize
both on-line and paper or board-based games?

  - **features-and-announcements**

New game announcements would go here, as well as site-wide or forum features.

  - **learning**

Another, catch-all category.  The posts featured here are more concerned with
the messy and sometimes painful process of learning.   Sometimes non-technology
learnings will go here.   Most importantly, any post that might be useful to
explain the motivations in why something was done with the Wordadoplicus would go here.
Thus, this post, is under the learning category.  

It may provide learning for someone else in the future.[^1]

[^1]: "someone else" includes this post's author at any time in the future.
