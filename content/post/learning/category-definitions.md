I am taking advantage of Hugo, the static site generator, to produce this blog site.  One of the things it encourages is the use of taxonomies, including categories, which you can see over there on the right.  

The above image I threw together in Omnigraffle to enumerate the categories.  

Here are the definitions:

  - **game-ideas**

All posts within this category are about **ideas** for word games and the technical and social challenges in implementing them.  They might be pie-in-the-sky or imminent.  

  - **community-ethos** 
  - **programming** 
  - **architecture**
  - **marketing-and-market-analysis**
  - **features-and-announcements**
  - **technology**
