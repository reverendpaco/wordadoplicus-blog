Questions:

1) Once I build an app in Elixir, how do I **use** it from my other Erlang application?
2) How do I get to my Amazon RDS?
  - make sure to re-read what you did to get the forum ready
  - make sure to change your security groups to expose the port
3) How do I join across multiple schemas/databases in Ecto?
